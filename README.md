# Color-Changing-Login-Logout

A React-Redux app that illustrates simple state-changing actions.  

The landing page displays empty fields for Name, Age, and Email.

![Before login](/src/assets/Before-login.png?raw=true "Before login")

Upon clicking the "Login" button those fields are filled with the app author's information.

![After login](/src/assets/After-login.png?raw=true "After login")

The color of the page's text can be changed by inputting the name of a color in the bottom field and then clicking the "Change Color" button. This can be done whether the user is logged-in or not.
